" Text-fixing macros:
" "current word" is the word which currently contains the cursor
" so commonly, you click the mouse at a word and then type the macro

map <F1> ? <CR>i,<ESC>
  " Insert a comma before the current word.
map <F2> ? <CR>i.<CR><ESC>~
  " Start a new sentence with the current word, i.e.
  " insert full stop before the (space before the) current word
  " and insert a newline, and upcase.
map <F3> b~
  " upcase the current word

" make sure to show as much as possible from the last (too long) line
